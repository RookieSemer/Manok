                      <p> "Joyful are people of integrity, who follow the instructions of the Lord. Joyful are those who obey his laws and search for him with all their hearts. They do not compromise with evil, and they walk only in his paths." </p>

                      <p>"Your laws endure to this day,
                        for all things serve you.
                     If your law had not been my delight,
                        I would have perished in my affliction.
                     I will never forget your precepts,
                        for by them you have preserved my life.</p>

                      <strong class="First">Psalm 16:20</strong>
                      <p>"Those who listen to instruction will prosper; those who trust the Lord will be joyful."</p>

                      <p>"And so, my children, listen to me, for all who follow my ways are joyful. Listen to my instruction and be wise. Don't ignore it. Joyful are those who listen to me, watching for me daily at my gates, waiting for me outside my home! For whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the Lord."</p>

                      <p> "Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand around with sinners, or join in with mockers. But they delight in the law of the Lord, meditating on it day and night. They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season. Their leaves never wither, and they prosper in all they do."</p>
                    
                      <strong class="First">Psalm 28:7</strong>
