                  <strong class="First">Jeremiah 29:11 </strong>
                      <p>For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.</p>
                     
                      <strong class="First"> Psalm 42:11</strong>
                      <p> “Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.” </p>
                     
                      <strong class="First">1 Corinthians 13:13  </strong>
                      <p>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love</p>

                      <strong class="First">Isaiah 40:31</strong>
                      <p>But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.</p>
                      
                      <strong class="First"> Psalm 121:7-8 </strong>
                      <p>The Lord will keep you from all harm— he will watch over your life; the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.</p>

                      <strong class="First"> Romans 15:13</strong>
                      <p>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                      
                      <strong class="First">Matthew 11:28</strong>
                      <p> Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.</p>
                    
                      <strong class="First">Hebrews 11:1</strong>
                      <p> Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.</p>

                      <strong class="First"> Psalm 119:114</strong>
                      <p>“Those who control their anger have great understanding; those with a hasty temper will make mistakes.” </p>

                      <strong class="First">Romans 5:3-4</strong>
                      <p>Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.</p>
